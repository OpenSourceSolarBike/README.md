Who wants to help with the OpenSourceSolarBike project?

At first, I planned selling the Maxun solarbike in small quantities, that’s why I patented it in the USA. But building the Maxun solarbike for saling takes a lot of man hours and is quite expensive, the bike would only be available to the happy few. So, I’m still the sole owner of the Maxun, but I wish everyone this pleasure. I don't have time right now to build solar bikes for selling because I'm working on other inventions such as a revolutionary new mid drive motor.

Although the solarbike is practically fully developed, there is still a lot of work to be done. Various improvements can be made, for example, it has recently become possible to glue the electrical connections of the solar cells. All electronic designs, mechanical CAD files and other documents must be sort out and updated from a collection of 24000 design files in 4700 folders.

Building the Maxun solarbike may be an interesting project for a technical university. An important point of concern is the construction of lightweight sandwich panels, for which there is no solution yet, see THIS article.

The solar bike also has another important purpose: it makes people understand that solar energy in the deserts is the only solution for the energy transition. With solar energy on desert power you can drive 30 km/h with a solar panel of just 1m2.
